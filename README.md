# HTTP Preferences Registration Requests

This repository's issues list manages requests to add and change entries in the [HTTP Preferences Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-parameters.xhtml#preferences). Please note our [contribution terms](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Your [Experts](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8126#section-4.6) are currently [@jasnell](https://github.com/jasnell) and [@reschke](https://github.com/reschke).

To request registration of a HTTP preference (or a change to an existing one), you can:

* [File an issue](https://github.com/protocol-registries/http-preferences/issues/new/choose) (preferred), or
* Send e-mail to [the mailing list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-parameters.xhtml#preferences).

See [RFC7240](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7240.html) for more information; in particular, the [requirements for registration](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7240.html#definitions).

Once approved, your request will be incorporated into the IANA registry, whereupon it will be officially registered.
